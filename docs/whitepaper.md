## 1. Introduction

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used in a wide range of scientific fields. However, managing and sharing NMR data can be challenging due to fragmented data storage and the use of multiple instances of NMR acquisition and processing software. NOMAD is a groundbreaking open-source web application that addresses these challenges by providing an integrated platform for NMR data management, ensuring data provenance, and simplifying data sharing and publication.

## 2. Problem Statement

Efficient management of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data in laboratory settings presents a significant challenge. While NMR spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique, the data it generates is often complex and voluminous. As researchers strive to adhere to the **[F.A.I.R](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)** (**F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable) research data principles, several obstacles hinder seamless data management and compliance. Data findability and accessibility is hindered by fragmented data storage on users' PCs and reliance on disparate software instances, making it challenging for researchers to locate relevant datasets efficiently. Furthermore, the conversion of NMR data into images pasted in Word or PDF documents for sharing and publication undermines data reusability. Accessibility also faces roadblocks due to the lack of a data repository that would serve as an equivalent to the **C**ambridge **C**rystallographic **D**ata **C**entre (**[CCDC](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/)**) for NMR data, leading to restricted access to already published NMR data and limited collaboration.

## 3 The NOMAD Solution

NOMAD offers a transformative solution for NMR data management that streamlines the adherence to **[F.A.I.R](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)** principles. NOMAD serves as an end-to-end data management solution, taking NMR data from its inception through the entire research process until publication. Researchers can initiate experiments via the Submission Portal, record and analyze NMR data using the NMR Lab Notebook powered by **[NMRium](https://www.nmrium.org/)**, and securely store the data and metadata in the platform's Data Storage feature. This seamless workflow eliminates the need for data downloads to users' PCs and ensures that a direct link to raw NMR data is maintained at every stage of the research journey.

Moreover, NOMAD's vision extends beyond the immediate horizon. Envisioning a future of collaborative innovation, NOMAD aspires to establish a decentralized peer-to-peer NMR Data Repository powered by the **[IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)** protocol. In this visionary approach, multiple NOMAD instances from diverse NMR labs globally converge to form a robust network, enabling seamless sharing of resources, data, and metadata. This innovative concept fosters a global community of researchers, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and catalyzing scientific advancements within the NMR domain. NOMAD's future vision aligns harmoniously with its present-day functionalities, aiming to drive collaboration and democratize NMR data management.
