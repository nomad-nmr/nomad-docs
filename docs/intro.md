## What is NMR?

**Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy** is an analytical technique used by chemists for quality control and research. It allows to determine the content and purity of a sample as well as molecular structures of unknown compounds. In another words, NMR can either be used to quantitatively analyse mixtures containing known compounds or identify entirely unknown compounds. Furthermore, NMR is utilised to study chemical and physical properties at the molecular level such as conformational exchange, reactivity, solubility and diffusion. In order to achieve that, hundreds of various NMR techniques were developed over the years. Due to high versatility, accuracy and reproducibility, NMR became absolutely essential analytical technique for modern chemistry research.

NMR spectrometers with very strong liquid helium-cooled superconducting magnets are relatively expensive and not easy to maintain. Therefore, they are usually placed in large central laboratories owned by universities or big private companies. However, the recent boom of less expensive bench-top instruments using permanent magnets and lower resolution resulted in expansion of NMR spectroscopy in some smaller and unusual niches.

### NMR spectrum as a finger print

NMR spectrum can be seen as a finger print of the electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional groups. Therefore, compounds can be identified by comparing their NMR spectra against spectral libraries of already known compounds. Unlike fingerprints, NMR spectra are highly predictable and molecular structure of unknown compound can be deduced entirely from NMR spectroscopy data. However, solving such NMR puzzle is not straightforward, multiple correlation NMR experiments are usually required and complexity increases dramatically with the size of the molecule.
