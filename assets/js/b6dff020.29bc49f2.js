Although the project has sparked quite considerable interest in the NMR community we have never managed to get it off the ground and install NOMAD in another NMR lab. About 3 years ago we run out of funding and students who built the prototypes have left St Andrews and I struggled to find new developers who would carry on the project with me. I assumed that the only way forward would be to find some substantial funding that would allow me to hire a developer who would be able to take over. I also thought that the project would be more sustainable if I would cross the the border and get better understanding of how web applications work and are built. Therefore, in January 2019 I started my self-taught developer journey. As soon as I started it became quite apparent that the best would be to start building NOMAD again from scratch using completely new stack. Eventually, I decided to focus on learning technologies that form so called ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"strong",href:"https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-mern-stack"},"MERN stack")),". In last three years, I put together plethora of small Javascript applications. At some point I got enough knowledge and confidence and started to work on a project that end up being my first take on a new NOMAD frond-end which is actually still quite close to what NOMAD v3 currently looks like and you can check it ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"strong",href:"https://nmr-control.netlify.app/dashboard"},"here")),". After that I continued the journey by learning the back-end technologies and my effort culminated in May last year when the front-end was connected to a brand new back-end which allowed me to shut down the first prototype of NOMAD that has been still in production as submission portal running on nearly 10 years old server that was on a verge of collapse. Then I carried on over the summer and added batch submission function that allows users in remote labs to submit samples in batches/racks which was essential for using NOMAD in our teaching labs. The end of last year was about bug fixing, adding some minor features and building this documentation website."),(0,r.kt)("div",{className:"admonition admonition-tip alert alert--success"},(0,r.kt)("div",{parentName:"div",className:"admonition-heading"},(0,r.kt)("h5",{parentName:"div"},(0,r.kt)("span",{parentName:"h5",className:"admonition-icon"},(0,r.kt)("svg",{parentName:"span",xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",width:"12",height:"16",viewBox:"0 0 12 16"},(0,r.kt)("path",{parentName:"svg",fillRule:"evenodd",d:"M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"}))),"Current ",(0,r.kt)("em",{parentName:"h5"},"Status Quo")," Summary")),(0,r.kt)("div",{parentName:"div",className:"admonition-content"},(0,r.kt)("ul",{parentName:"div"},(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},"The third prototype of NOMAD system is built using completely different tech stack and the overall concept and idea is the only thing that it has in common with its predecessors.")),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},"NOMAD v3 has been successfully working for about 6 months connected to 6 Bruker NMR instruments of various generations ranging from AV to AV-III-HD.

However, I believe that a bit of human-computer interaction research could cut it through to success.
