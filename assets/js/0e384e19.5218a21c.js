It allows to determine the content and purity of a sample as well as molecular structures of unknown compounds. In another words, NMR can either be used to quantitatively analyse mixtures containing known compounds or identify entirely unknown compounds. Furthermore, NMR is utilised to study chemical and physical properties at the molecular level such as conformational exchange, reactivity, solubility and diffusion.
