The development of those prototypes was initiated and supported by funding provided by <strong><a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPSRC</a></strong> (Strategic Partners Project, Impact Accelaration Account). Although the project has sparked quite considerable interest in the NMR community we have never managed to get it off the ground and install NOMAD in another NMR lab. About 3 years ago we run out of funding and students who built the prototypes have left St Andrews and I struggled to find new developers who would carry on the project with me. I assumed that the only way forward would be to find some substantial funding that would allow me to hire a developer who would be able to take over. I also thought that the project would be more sustainable if I would cross the the border and get better understanding of how web applications work and are built. Therefore, in January 2019 I started my self-taught developer journey. As soon as I started it became quite apparent that the best would be to start building NOMAD again from scratch using completely new stack. Eventually, I decided to focus on learning technologies that form so called <strong><a href="https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-mern-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MERN stack</a></strong>. In last three years, I put together plethora of small Javascript applications. At some point I got enough knowledge and confidence and started to work on a project that end up being my first take on a new NOMAD frond-end which is actually still quite close to what NOMAD v3 currently looks like and you can check it <strong><a href="https://nmr-control.netlify.app/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></strong>. After that I continued the journey by learning the back-end technologies and my effort culminated in May last year when the front-end was connected to a brand new back-end which allowed me to shut down the first prototype of NOMAD that has been still in production as submission portal running on nearly 10 years old server that was on a verge of collapse. Then I carried on over the summer and added batch submission function that allows users in remote labs to submit samples in batches/racks which was essential for using NOMAD in our teaching labs. The end of last year was about bug fixing, adding some minor features and building this documentation website.</p><div class="admonition admonition-tip alert alert--success"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="12" height="16" viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Current <em>Status Quo</em> Summary</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><ul><li><p>The third prototype of NOMAD system is built using completely different tech stack and the overall concept and idea is the only thing that it has in common with its predecessors.</p></li><li><p>NOMAD v3 has been successfully working for about 6 months connected to 6 Bruker NMR instruments of various generations ranging from AV to AV-III-HD. Thus, it seems that the prototype is ready to use MVP but currently fulfils only small subset of functions (lab monitoring and submission portal).</p></li><li><p>Last but not least, NOMAD v3 source code is publicly available on <strong><a href="https://github.com/nomad-nmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></strong> under <strong><a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGPL-3.0 license</a></strong>.</p></li></ul></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="future-outlook">Future Outlook<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#future-outlook" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>The next major milestone on the road map is the data storage function and experimental time accounting for monitoring dashboard. This will complement the trio of core NOMAD features and will allow to decommission ageing and stale v2 prototype. I challenge myself to reach this goal by summer this year although making any plans like that it&#x27;s quite hard in the current environment. However, for couple of reasons the development of v3 is significantly faster than it was ever before and thus I try to keep the optimistic outlook. Another improvement that I plan for this year is implementing <strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a></strong> technology which should significantly improve server infrastructure and streamline installation process. I also plan to carry on and add some more content on this documentation website. So far, I have tried to describe the current installation procedure as detailed as possible which could allow other NMR lab managers to possibly trial the system in their labs. Next, I want to add more information in <strong><a href="/website/docs/features/intro">features section</a></strong> that it becomes more clear how the system operates and what benefits it brings.</p><p><strong>NMR Lab Notebook</strong> and <strong>Decentralised Data Repository</strong> can be seen as advanced features and it will very likely take a while until we get there. The former should facilitate collaborative interpretation of NMR data and preserving work that has been done for future use and publication. We have done a bit of work on that in v2 prototype but it is very far from ideal, quite cumbersome to use and thus usually neglected by users. However, I believe that a bit of human-computer interaction research could cut it through to success. The latter should ultimately allow to do the same on global level but there is no point to talk about this in details yet as without any adoption of NOMAD system in multiple NMR labs this feature only remains in the realm of my dreams.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>NOMAD has been developed using direct feedback from everyday users in the NMR lab and the most important thing for further development is getting such feedback from wider NMR community. If you are NMR lab manager and have a feeling that you could benefit from using NOMAD in your lab check the <strong><a href="/website/docs/getting-started/system-overview">installation instructions</a></strong>. If that looks too daunting for you there might be somebody in IT-services who could understand and give you hand. Likely, you will need help from IT services anyway to spin up a VM for the server. Although you can run NOMAD from Linux box sitting under your office desk, using properly maintained web hosting VM will improve resilience of your system. Last but not least, get back to me with any questions that you might possibly have. I will always appreciate any kind of feedback from active or potential users of the system.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg blogPostDetailsFull_xD8n"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_NBRY padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_F03v"><a class="tag_WK-t tagRegular_LXbV" href="/website/blog/tags/nomad">NOMAD</a></li><li class="tag_F03v"><a class="tag_WK-t tagRegular_LXbV" href="/website/blog/tags/background">background</a></li><li class="tag_F03v"><a class="tag_WK-t tagRegular_LXbV" href="/website/blog/tags/future">future</a></li></ul></div><div class="col margin-top--sm"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/main/website/blog/blog/2022-01-06-welcome.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_mS5F" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/website/blog/datastore"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« <!-- -->On the way to datastore</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_vrFS thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#background" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Background</a></li><li><a href="#future-outlook" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Future Outlook</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item">
